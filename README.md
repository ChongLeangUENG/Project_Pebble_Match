Portfolio Project is the last project of the Holberton School. We decided to make a Portfolio Project about an application web called “Pebble Match”. 

# What is Pebble Match?
Pebble Match is a matchmaker website. There is no judgment on people’s looks. Pebble Match matches people by a questionnaire on habits and values, which is a fundamental (albeit often overlooked) element in a relationship.
